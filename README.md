## Goal

Itâ€™s time to take my app development skills to the next level. I will introduce you to the wonderful world of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet. 

## What I will create

By the end of the module, I will have made a beautiful, dark-mode-enabled weather app. I'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone and by searching for a city manually. 

## What I will learn

* How to create a dark-mode-enabled app.
* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Learn to use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Learn about the delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift guard keyword. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
